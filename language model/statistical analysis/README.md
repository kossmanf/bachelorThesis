# Statistical Analysis Scripts

## evalEpochs.py / evalEpochs_lossFunctionComparison.py

This script processes different backed-up epoch files by extracting the state disc to evaluate the trained model at each epoch using various loss functions. It requires the model and test data to function. Ensure these are properly configured before execution. It is essential to execute this before calculating residuals as it provides the necessary data for subsequent analysis.

## evalUntrainedModel.py

This script evaluates the performance of an untrained language model using test data. It calculates residuals, predicted scores, and actual scores, and outputs them in an evaluation file.  It is essential to execute this before calculating residuals as it provides the necessary data for subsequent analysis. 

## calculateBootstrappedStatistics.py

This script performs statistical analysis using bootstrapping methods to estimate Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Error (ME), and the standard deviation of absolute errors from evaluation files across training epochs. It's useful for tracking and analyzing training progress in machine learning experiments.

## plotStatistics.py

This script reads data from a JSON file (`bootstrapped_data.json`) containing bootstrapped statistical results and plots the Mean Error, Mean Absolute Error, and standard deviation of absolute errors over training epochs. The output is a line chart which helps in visualizing the performance and stability of the model across the epochs.

### Usage

1. First, execute `evalEpochs.py` or `evalEpochs_lossFunctionComparison.py` or `evalUntrainedModel.py` to generate evaluation data:
   ```
   python evalEpochs.py
   ```
   ```
   python evalEpochs_lossFunctionComparison.py
   ```
   ```
   evalUntrainedModel.py
   ```

2. Run `calculateBootstrappedStatistics.py` to generate the necessary statistical data:
   ```
   python calculateBootstrappedStatistics.py
   ```

3. Use `plotStatistics.py` to visualize the data:
   ```
   python plotStatistics.py
   ```

### Requirements

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following:
- A trained model
- Test data

These components are crucial for the scripts to function as intended.

Ensure that the data generated by the scripts is appropriately saved and transferred between them as expected.
